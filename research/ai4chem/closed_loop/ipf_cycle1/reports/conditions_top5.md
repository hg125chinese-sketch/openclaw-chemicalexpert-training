# IPF Cycle1 (ALK5) Top5 — reaction condition annotations (rules-based)

Source: chem-rxn-conditions rule DB (yields are typical ranges, not substrate-specific).

## #1  amide_formation

SMILES: `CC1=C(NC(=O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl)CC=NNCOC(=O)NC=C1`

- Solvent(s): DMF, DCM, NMP
- Base: DIPEA, NMM
- Coupling reagent: HATU, HBTU, EDC/HOBt, T3P
- Temp: 0–25 °C
- Time: 2–12 h
- Step yield (typical): 60–95%
- Overall yield (single-step): 60–95%
- Notes: Pre-activate acid 5–10 min; choose HATU for hindered substrates.

## #2  reductive_amination

SMILES: `CCOC=CC=NC1C=C2C=NCN=C2CCc2ccc(F)cc2C(=O)N1`

- Solvent(s): DCM, MeOH, DCE, THF
- Reducing agent: NaBH(OAc)3, NaBH3CN
- Temp: 0–25 °C
- Time: 2–18 h
- Step yield (typical): 50–90%
- Overall yield (single-step): 50–90%
- Notes: Pre-form imine ~30 min; slightly acidic (AcOH) often helps.

## #3  reductive_amination

SMILES: `CC(N)[C@@H]1N=C(N)C=CC=CC=C(C=O)C(c2c(F)cccc2Cl)=Cc2cc(F)ccc2N1`

- Reducing agent: NaBH(OAc)3, NaBH3CN
- Temp: 0–25 °C
- Time: 2–18 h
- Step yield (typical): 50–90%
- Overall yield (single-step): 50–90%
- Notes: Pre-form imine ~30 min; slightly acidic (AcOH) often helps.

## #4  reductive_amination

SMILES: `CC(C)C=NN(C)OCC=CCc1c2cc(O)cc1NC=N2`

- Solvent(s): DCM, MeOH, DCE, THF
- Reducing agent: NaBH(OAc)3, NaBH3CN
- Temp: 0–25 °C
- Time: 2–18 h
- Step yield (typical): 50–90%
- Overall yield (single-step): 50–90%
- Notes: Pre-form imine ~30 min; slightly acidic (AcOH) often helps.

## #5  ester_formation

- Reagent option(s): acid chloride (if available), EDC/DMAP, DCC/DMAP
- Temp: 0–25 °C
- Time: 2–12 h
- Step yield (typical): 50–90%
- Overall yield (single-step): 50–90%
- Notes: Many variants exist; if possible use activated acid derivatives.
