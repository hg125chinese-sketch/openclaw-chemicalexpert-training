# Reactivity & Safety: Structural Alert Screening

Drug candidates can look great on paper — good activity, decent QED, passing Lipinski — and still fail because they contain structural features that cause toxicity, metabolic instability, or assay interference. This skill turns medicinal chemistry safety knowledge into computable, auditable gates.

## When to Use

- After molecular generation (skill 3) and ADMET filtering (skill 6), before final ranking
- When evaluating candidates for **chronic disease** targets (IPF, diabetes, autoimmune) — safety bar is higher
- When a candidate contains unusual functional groups or unfamiliar motifs
- When building or updating a project-specific denylist
- As part of the chem-experiment (skill 12) DMTA cycle gate system

## Core Philosophy

1. **Structural alerts are not predictions — they are red flags.** A hit doesn't mean the molecule is toxic. It means the molecule needs extra scrutiny before advancing. But in early-stage virtual screening, extra scrutiny means "remove it" unless there's a compelling reason to keep it.
2. **Layer your filters: universal → context-specific.** PAINS and reactive metabolite alerts apply to everything. Chronic disease flags (metabolic stability, covalent liability) are context-dependent. Don't apply chronic disease gates to an oncology program where covalent inhibitors are intentional.
3. **Every flag must be auditable.** The output is not just "failed" — it's "failed rule X because SMARTS Y matched atoms Z." The chemist (or agent) must be able to inspect and override with justification.
4. **This skill complements ADMET (skill 6), not replaces it.** ADMET covers drug-likeness properties (LogP, TPSA, QED). This skill covers structural liabilities that ADMET doesn't catch — reactive groups, toxicophores, metabolic soft spots.
5. **When in doubt, flag it.** False positives are cheap (you just review them). False negatives are expensive (a toxic compound advances).

## Phase 1: Universal Structural Alerts (Always Apply)

### 1.1 PAINS (Pan-Assay Interference Compounds)

PAINS are molecules that give false positives in many assay types. They're not necessarily toxic, but they waste experimental resources.

```python
#!/opt/conda/envs/chem/bin/python
"""PAINS filter using RDKit's built-in FilterCatalog."""
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem.FilterCatalog import FilterCatalog, FilterCatalogParams


def get_pains_catalog():
    """Load RDKit's built-in PAINS filter catalog."""
    params = FilterCatalogParams()
    params.AddCatalog(FilterCatalogParams.FilterCatalogs.PAINS)
    return FilterCatalog(params)


PAINS_CATALOG = get_pains_catalog()


def check_pains(smi):
    """Check a molecule against PAINS filters.

    Returns:
        dict with keys:
        - smiles: input
        - valid: bool
        - is_pains: bool
        - hits: list of (filter_name, description)
    """
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smi)
    if mol is None:
        return {"smiles": smi, "valid": False, "is_pains": False, "hits": []}

    entries = PAINS_CATALOG.GetMatches(mol)
    hits = [(e.GetDescription(), str(e.GetFilterMatches(mol)))
            for e in entries]

    return {
        "smiles": smi,
        "valid": True,
        "is_pains": len(hits) > 0,
        "hits": hits,
    }
```

### 1.2 Reactive Metabolite Alerts

These motifs can form reactive intermediates (epoxides, quinones, nitroso compounds) that covalently modify proteins, causing idiosyncratic toxicity.

```python

## Phase 2: Genotoxicity / Mutagenicity Alerts

### 2.1 Beilstein/Lhasa Alerts (Simplified)

These patterns are associated with Ames-positive (mutagenic) outcomes:

## Phase 5: Integration with DMTA Pipeline

### 5.1 Decision Tree

```
After ADMET gates (skill 6), before docking (skill 9):
│
├── Run full_safety_screen(smi, is_chronic=<target_context>)
│
├── overall_severity == "danger"?
│   ├── YES → REJECT. Do not dock. Log reason.
│   └── NO → Continue to docking.
│
├── overall_severity == "warning"?
│   ├── Add to "flagged" list with alert details
│   ├── Continue to docking, but tag in final report
│   └── In Top 5 output: explicitly note warnings for chemist review
│
└── In cycle summary (skill 12):
    ├── Report: N molecules rejected by safety screen
    ├── Report: top 3 most frequent alerts in pool
    └── If >20% rejected → flag generation quality issue

    Example:
        ipf_extras = [
            ("ipf_n_oxide_risk", "[NX3](=O)", "N-oxide risk for IPF chronic dosing"),
        ]
        ipf_alerts = make_project_denylist(ipf_extras)
    """
    combined = REACTIVE_METABOLITE_ALERTS + additional_alerts
    return compile_alerts(combined)
```

## Failure Modes

1. **SMARTS too broad → excessive false positives.** For example, a generic `[NH2]` pattern matches amino acids and simple amines that are perfectly safe. Always use the most specific SMARTS that captures the actual liability (e.g., `[NH2]-c` for aromatic amines, not `[NH2]`).

2. **Missing context → wrong severity.** A Michael acceptor acrylamide is "danger" for an IPF chronic drug but "by design" for a covalent kinase inhibitor. Always pass `is_chronic` correctly. When unsure, flag and let the chemist decide.

3. **Confusing structural alerts with toxicity.** An alert means "investigate further," not "this molecule is toxic." Many approved drugs contain structural alerts (metformin has an N-N bond, vorinostat has a hydroxamic acid). The difference is that those went through extensive safety testing.

4. **Alert fatigue from noisy screens.** If >50% of your pool gets flagged, the alerts are too broad or your generator is producing low-quality molecules. Check which specific alerts fire most and tighten or remove the noisy ones.

5. **Not updating project denylist.** If you discover a new problematic motif during a project (like the N-N bond in IPF Cycle 1), add it to the project denylist immediately. Don't rely on memory.

## Relationship to Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| chem-admet (6) | ADMET covers drug-likeness properties; this skill covers structural liabilities. Run ADMET first, then safety screen. |
| chem-kinase-sar (13) | Kinase SAR checks "does it look like a kinase inhibitor?"; this skill checks "is it safe?" Both are pre-docking gates. |
| chem-molgen (3) | If safety screen rejects >20% of generated pool, the generator is producing too many problematic motifs → generation quality issue. |
| chem-experiment (12) | Safety screen is a hard gate in the DMTA cycle. "danger" = reject, "warning" = flag. |

## One-Sentence Rule

**Every candidate must pass structural alert screening before entering final ranking — "danger" is a hard reject, "warning" is a flag for chemist review.**
